- I'd also like to hear more about good approaches to planning, where to start which motions to go through (with david it was about start simple and then move on) but that requieres one to know that there are multiple ways xD (AFTERNOON)

- Can we get an overview on Parameterized selectors? Iâ€™m still confused on them.

- Is it possible to have an explanation in the exercise which we have to list pizzas of each restaurant ?
